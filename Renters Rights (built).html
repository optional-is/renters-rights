	<h3 id="article-1">Article 1</h3>
	
	<p id="article-1-paragraph-1">This Act applies to all leases covering the use of buildings or parts of buildings, including the sub-letting of premises, in return for a consideration. This Act shall apply both to residential premises and business premises. If premises are let both for residential occupation and for other purposes, the provisions of the Act regarding residential premises shall apply to the agreements involved. Provisions of this Act, which are worded so as to apply to residential premises, shall apply to business premises as appropriate and where no special provisions are to be found in the Act applying to business premises.</p>

	<p id="article-1-paragraph-2">Furthermore, this Act shall apply to the use of premises according to a work contract or the annex to such a contract.</p>

	<p id="article-1-paragraph-3">This Act shall apply even though the consideration is rendered partly or entirely by a means other than with money, e.g. by means of a labour contribution.</p>

	<p id="article-1-paragraph-4">Where leases cover other matters as well as the use of premises in return for a consideration, this Act shall apply to them provided that the latter constitutes their main import.</p>

	<p id="article-1-paragraph-5">Where a lease also covers land that is to be used in connection with the use of premises, it shall be subject to this Act unless the land is to be used for agricultural purposes.</p>

	<p id="article-1-paragraph-6">This Act shall not apply to agreements made between hotels, guesthouses and comparable entities and their guests. Nor shall the provisions of this Act apply to the short-term rental of premises such as holiday centres, holiday cottages, community centres, gymnasiums, rooms or storerooms in which rent is charged per week, per day or for shorter periods.</p>

	<p id="article-1-paragraph-7">Finally, this Act shall not apply to leases for the use of premises that are subject to special rules according to other legislation.</p>

	<p id="article-2-paragraph-1">Leases may not be made under which the tenant of residential premises undertakes more extensive
	obligations and acquires less extensive rights than are provided for by this Act unless the Act contains special provisions allowing for such deviations.</p>

	<p id="article-2-paragraph-2">The provisions of this Act regarding business premises, on the other hand, are non-obligatory, and shall therefore apply to such premises only where no other terms are agreed.</p>

	<p id="article-2-paragraph-3">If residential premises are let to specific groups of persons, e.g. students, the elderly or the handicapped, where particular circumstances call for arrangements other than those provided for under this Act, then notwithstanding paragraph 1 above, deviations may be made from individual provisions of this Act by agreement due to the special nature or purpose of the activity involved.</p>

The deposit in the landlord’s keeping shall be index-linked, but shall not bear interest. At the end of the rental period the landlord shall state as soon as possible whether he lays claim to the deposit or reserves the right to do so. Alternatively, he shall repay the deposit to the tenant, with indexation adjustment, without undue delay. At no time may the landlord retain a deposit in his keeping without laying a claim to it for more than two months after the return of the premises, cf. paragraph 1 of Article 64.</li>
		<li>A deposit of a type other than those listed in items 1-4 above which the tenant proposes and the landlord accepts as valid and satisfactory.</li>
	</ol><p id="article-40-paragraph-2">The monetary sum, or maximum of a deposit under items 1-3 and 5 of paragraph 1 shall be as agreed between the parties, but a deposit under item 4 of paragraph 1 may not amount to more than the equivalent of three months’ rent.</p>

	<p id="article-40-paragraph-3">The landlord may choose between the types of deposit in paragraph 1, but the tenant shall have the right to refuse to advance a monetary deposit according to item 4 of paragraph 1, providing he offers another type of deposit instead which the landlord regards as satisfactory.</p>

	<p id="article-40-paragraph-4">The deposit under items 1-3 and 5 shall expire and become invalid when two months have elapsed from the return of the premises unless the landlord has made a claim that is covered by the deposit before that time, cf. paragraph 1 of <a href="#article-64">Article 64</a>. When the deposit or guarantee under this paragraph has
expired, the landlord shall return to the tenant all negotiable documents or other certificates that he has submitted as a deposit and that the tenant has a legally-protected right or reasonable claim to have returned to him.</p>

	<p id="article-40-paragraph-5">When a deposit is put up under items 1-3 and 5 of paragraph 1, the landlord shall take measures, to the extent that can be regarded as natural and reasonable, to ensure that the guarantors or insurers are informed of non-performance by the tenant and of other matters that may have a bearing on their interests and liability.</p>

	<h2 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8 — Access by the landlord to the rented premises</h2>

	<h3 id="article-41">Article 41</h3>
	
	<p id="article-41-paragraph-1">The landlord shall have the right of access to the rented premises, with suitable notice and in consultation with the tenant so as to avoid going against his interests and those of the tenant, in order to have improvements made to the rented premises and to inspect their condition and the way they are being treated. However, the landlord may never enter the rented premises when the tenant or his agent is not present without first obtaining the tenant’s permission.</p>

	<p id="article-41-paragraph-2">During the last six months of the rental period, the landlord may display the rented premises for a certain length of time each day, though never for more than two hours per day, to prospective tenants or purchasers, but shall at all times announce such visits with at least one day’s notice. When the premises are displayed in this way, the tenant or his agent shall always be present. The parties may, however, agree between themselves on another arrangement.</p>

	<h2 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9 — Sale of rented premises, assignment of the right to rent, sub-letting, etc.</h2>

	<h3 id="article-42">Article 42</h3>
	
	<p id="article-42-paragraph-1">The sale of rented premises shall not be subject to the approval of the tenant. Thus, the landlord may assign his right of ownership of the rented premises, and thus his rights and obligations vis-à-vis the tenant under this Act and the lease.</p>

	<p id="article-42-paragraph-2">When such an assignment takes place, the original landlord shall normally be released from all connections and obligations towards the tenant, and the purchaser shall replace him completely in this respect.</p>

	<p id="article-42-paragraph-3">If no other arrangements are agreed, the purchaser shall take over all the seller’s rights and obligations regarding the tenant as from the agreed day of transfer of the property.</p>

	<p id="article-42-paragraph-4">The general legal status of the tenant shall remain unaltered and identical despite the change of ownership: his obligations shall not be increased nor his rights reduced.</p>

	<p id="article-42-paragraph-5">When a change of ownership of rented premises takes place as a result of the bankruptcy of the landlord or a sale in execution, special rules shall apply under the Bankruptcy Act and the Sales in Execution Act, which provide for exceptions from the general rules set forth above.</p>

	<h3 id="article-43">Article 43</h3>
	
	<p id="article-43-paragraph-1">When rented premises are sold, the original landlord shall inform the tenant of the sale and change of ownership in a verifiable manner without unreasonable delay and not less than 30 days after the signature of the purchase agreement.</p>

	<p id="article-43-paragraph-2">The announcement shall state the name, address and ID No. of the new owner, the time on which the change of ownership is based as regards the tenant, how rent payments are to be made and all other matters and details which it is necessary for the tenant to be informed about.</p>

	<p id="article-43-paragraph-3">The tenant should pay rent, and direct all communications, complaints and notices concerning the rented premises, to the original landlord until he has received a notification regarding a different arrangement in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.</p>

	<h3 id="article-44">Article 44</h3>
	
	<p id="article-44-paragraph-1">The tenant may not assign his right of tenancy or sub-let the rented premises without the landlord’s approval unless other provisions are made in this Chapter. It shall not be regarded as constituting assignment of the right of tenancy or as sub-letting if the tenant permits close family relations or relatives by marriage to live in the rented premises together with him or his immediate family, providing that the number of persons in the home remains within normal limits in terms of the size and design of the rented premises.</p>

	<h3 id="article-45">Article 45</h3>
	
	<p id="article-45-paragraph-1">If the tenant dies before the end of the rental period, the tenant’s estate at death may terminate the lease with the normal notice even though the lease was made for a longer term. The tenant’s surviving spouse, family relations or relatives by marriage who were members of the tenant’s household at the time of his death, or made their living from employment pursued in the premises, and who wish to take over the lease with its rights and obligations, shall be permitted to do so in place of the tenant unless the landlord presents valid reasons why they should not do this.</p>

	<h3 id="article-46">Article 46</h3>
	
	<p id="article-46-paragraph-1">If a tenant moves out of premises on which he has entered into a lease, his spouse who has lived with him in the premises shall have the right to retain the lease in the same way as is provided for in <a href="#article-45">Article 45</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="article-47">Article 47</h3>
	
	<p id="article-47-paragraph-1">When a married couple have rented residential premises jointly and their marriage is dissolved, the entitlement to rent the premises shall be subject to the provisions of the Act in Respect of Marriage. The spouse who uses business premises to the greater extent due to his or her employment shall have a priority right to the continuing rental of the premises, irrespective of which spouse signed the lease. The landlord’s right to terminate a lease due to a dissolution of marriage shall be subject to the final provision of <a href="#article-45">Article 45</a>, as appropriate.</p>

	<h3 id="article-48">Article 48</h3>
	
	<p id="article-48-paragraph-1">Neither spouse shall be able to waive in a legally binding manner the right guaranteed to the other under the provisions of this Chapter to take over the lease.</p>

	<h3 id="article-49">Article 49</h3>
	
	<p id="article-49-paragraph-1">If the tenant of business premises dies and his estate at death decides to sell the business operations that were pursued there, the landlord shall not be able to base the termination of the lease or a demand for an amendment to the substance of the lease specifically on these circumstances, providing that the sale value of such business operations depends on the continuing use of the leased premises and the fact that the same use will continue to be made of them. The same shall apply, as appropriate, if the reason for the sale of the business operations is the dissolution of the tenant’s cohabitational relationship or marriage, or the tenant’s bankruptcy.</p>

	<h3 id="article-50">Article 50</h3>
	
	<p id="article-50-paragraph-1">When the tenant is an employee of the landlord and has received residential premises for rent as a consequence of this employment, the lease shall expire without special notice if the tenant stops work at his own request or is lawfully dismissed from his job because of offences committed at work or because his period of employment, as agreed in advance, has expired.</p>

	<h3 id="article-51">Article 51</h3>
	
	<p id="article-51-paragraph-1">At the end of an agreed rental period, the tenant of residential premises shall have a priority right to rent the premises, providing that they are available for rent for at least one year. The tenant’s priority right to rent shall not apply:</p>

	<ol><li>In the case of a single person’s room.</li>
		<li>If the rented premises are in the same building as the landlord himself lives in.</li>
		<li>If the dwelling is rented with furniture, either fully-furnished or furnished to a substantial degree.</li>
		<li>If the landlord takes the premises over for his own use.</li>
		<li>If the landlord puts, or intends to put, the premises at the disposal of his relations in direct line of descent, adoptive children, foster-children, siblings, nephews or nieces or parents-in-law.</li>
		<li>If the landlord intends to sell the premises during the six months following the end of the rental period. If the sale is intended during this period, or during the six months following, the parties may, notwithstanding other provisions of this Act, agree on an end to the rental period with particular conditions and on evacuation when the premises are to be handed over to the new owner. If the new owner intends to continue to let the premises out, the tenant shall have a priority right to rent them, though with the same limitations that applies under the other items of this paragraph.</li>
		<li>If substantial repairs, maintenance work or alterations are planned during the six months following the end of the rental period, which, in the opinion of a building officer, would render the premises, unfit for habitation for at least two months.</li>
		<li>If the tenant is an employee of the landlord and has been provided with the rented premises because of the job or in connection with it.</li>
		<li>If the tenant has, during the rental period, been guilty of non-performance or violation of the lease that may justify its rescission.</li>
		<li>If the tenant has in some other way neglected his obligations or conducted himself in such a way as to make it natural to suppose that the landlord does not wish to continue to rent him the premises, or if important reasons of another type argue against the tenant’s having a priority right.</li>
		<li>If a fair assessment of the interests of both parties and the overall circumstances argues against the tenant’s having a priority right.</li>
	</ol><h3 id="article-52">Article 52</h3>
	
	<p id="article-52-paragraph-1">If the tenant wishes to exercise his priority right under paragraph 1 of <a href="#article-51">Article 51</a>, he shall notify the landlord of this in writing by verifiable means at least three months before the expiry of the lease at the end of the notice period or the end of the rental period. Otherwise his priority right will lapse.</p>

	<p id="article-52-paragraph-2">If the landlord considers that the tenant does not have a priority right due to the reasons stated in paragraph 2 of <a href="#article-51">Article 51</a>, he shall, within 14 days of his receipt of the notification according to paragraph 1, give the tenant a reasoned account of his point of view, in writing, stating the reasons preventing the tenant from exercising his priority right. If he does not do this, he shall be regarded as having recognised the tenant’s priority right, unless circumstances are such as to make such an announcement unnecessary, e.g. if reasons are stated clearly in the lease or the notice of termination which exclude the exercising of the priority right.</p>

	<h3 id="article-53">Article 53</h3>
	
	<p id="article-53-paragraph-1">When a lease is renewed under the provisions of Articles 51 and 52, the rent shall be normal and fair from the point of view of both parties. It is likely that the rent that applied previously will be fair, and it shall be up to the party who disagrees with this view to demonstrate the contrary. Other conditions set for the renewal of the lease shall also apply providing they are not unfair or contrary to good rental custom.</p>

	<p id="article-53-paragraph-2">In other respects, the conditions of a renewed lease shall be they same as those of the original lease.</p>

	<h3 id="article-54">Article 54</h3>
	
	<p id="article-54-paragraph-1">If, e.g. by means of an agreement concluded purely as a simulated contract or by deception, the landlord intentionally takes over rented premises, or takes action that results in the tenant’s losing his priority right, then he shall compensate the tenant for any demonstrable financial loss incurred.</p>

	<p id="article-54-paragraph-2">The tenant shall submit a claim for compensation under paragraph 1 in a verifiable manner within six months of the date on which he vacates the premises. Otherwise his right to compensation shall lapse, except where the landlord has employed deception.</p>

	<ol><li>One month for both parties in the case of individual rooms, storage sheds and similar types of premises, irrespective of the purpose for which they are used.</li>
		<li>Six months for both parties in the case of dwellings; by “dwelling” is meant any type of premises in which a family is able to have normal home facilities. If the tenant has rented the dwelling for more than five years, the notice period for termination by the landlord shall be one year.</li>

	<p id="article-57-paragraph-1">The notice period shall be regarded as beginning on the first day of the month following that in which the notice of termination is sent. The tenant shall have completed the evacuation and clearing up of the rented premises by 13:00 hours on the day following the end of the notice period.</p>

	<p id="article-57-paragraph-2">Where the length of the notice period under <a href="#article-56">Article 56</a> depends on the length of the rental period, this shall be the time up to the date when the notice of termination is sent.</p>

	<h3 id="article-58">Article 58</h3>
	
	<p id="article-58-paragraph-1">A lease made for a definite period shall expire on the agreed date without special notice of termination or announcement by the parties. A lease made for a definite period may not be dissolved by termination during the agreed rental period. It may, however, be agreed that such a lease may be terminated due to special grounds, events or circumstances, which shall then be stated in the lease. Termination of this type shall be made in writing, with reasons stated, and the mutual notice period for termination shall be at least three months.</p>

	<h3 id="article-59">Article 59</h3>
	
	<p id="article-59-paragraph-1">When two months have elapsed following the end of the rental period according to the notice of termination or the provisions of a lease made for a definite period, and the tenant continues to utilise the rented premises, the landlord may demand to have the lease renewed indefinitely.

		<li>If there is a substantial delay in the handing over of the premises. If the landlord is responsible for such a delay, the tenant shall also be entitled to compensation.</li>
		<li>If, for reasons that can not be attributed to the tenant, the quality of the premises deteriorates during the rental period to such an extent that they can no longer be used for the intended purpose or are regarded as posing a health hazard in the opinion of the health authorities.</li>
		<li>If the landlord is guilty of repeated, substantial or deceitful failure to honour his obligation to maintain the premises in a rentable condition and carry out the necessary repairs and maintenance work quickly and effectively. It shall be a condition for rescission under this item that the tenant shall previously have requested the landlord to make good his failure to honour these obligations, giving him a reasonable period in which to do so.</li>
		<li>If the tenant’s right is substantially abridged as a result of legislation or other public instructions or because it is at variance with other restrictions that rest on the property. The landlord shall also be liable to compensate for direct loss sustained by the tenant as a result of such abridgement if he knew of the abridgement, or could have been expected to know of it, when the lease was made and neglected to bring it to the tenant’s attention.</li>
		<li>If the tenant’s normal use or domestic peace is substantially disrupted by disturbances or inconvenience arising from substantial or repeated violations, by other persons who are entitled to make use of the same building, of the rules of conduct or local rules, providing that the landlord has neglected his obligation under paragraph 4 of Article 31, in spite of the tenants requisition, or the circumstances are in other respects such that it is fair and natural that the tenant should be able to revoke the lease. Such circumstances may depend, for example, on the nature of the violations and disturbance, and also on whether further violations and disturbances are foreseeable and likely.</li>
		<li>If the landlord repeatedly or substantially violates the tenant’s right to have the agreed undiminished control and use of the rented premises, e.g. by obstructing or restricting utilisation or by entering or occupying the rented premises without authorisation, or if the landlord is guilty of a punishable offence against the tenant or his family.</li>

		<li>If the tenant is to pay part or all of the rent in the form of labour and grossly neglects this obligation or displays gross incompetence in his work.</li>
		<li>If the tenant uses the premises in a manner other than that provided for in this Act or in the lease and otherwise permitted in law and does not desist from misusing them in this way despite a written demand by the landlord.</li>
		<li>If the tenant assigns his right of tenancy or misuses his right to sub-let the premises according to Chapter 9, or if the sub-tenant is guilty of any conduct of the type that entitles the landlord to revoke the lease with the original tenant.</li>

		<li>If the tenant vacates the premises before the end of the rental period without having taken the necessary measures to look after them and protect them.</li>
		<li>If the quality of the premises deteriorates while they are in the care of the tenant due to bad treatment and carelessness on the part of persons for whom the tenant is responsible and he does not respond immediately to a demand by the landlord to rectify the situation, cf. Article 18.</li>
		<li>If, despite demands from the landlord, the tenant neglects his duty to ensure that good order is maintained in the rented premises and that they are treated well, cf. Article 30, or is guilty of acts of personal malice against the landlord or his family.</li>
		<li>If, notwithstanding complaints by the landlord, the tenant of commercial or catering premises neglects his duty to maintain normal activities and traditional operations, cf. Article 31.</li>

This shall not apply, however, when the tenant has failed in a deceitful manner to perform his obligations or when the grounds for rescission are failure to pay the rent at the right time, cf. item 1 of paragraph 1.</p>

	<h3 id="article-62">Article 62</h3>
	
	<p id="article-62-paragraph-1">If the lease is revoked for any of the reasons listed in <a href="#article-61">Article 61</a>, the tenant shall compensate the landlord for the damages resulting directly from his non-performance.

	<p id="article-62-paragraph-2">However, the landlord shall immediately take the necessary measures to let the premises out as soon as possible in return for suitable rent, and the rent income he receives, or should receive, in this manner shall set off the rent compensation under paragraph 1.</p>
